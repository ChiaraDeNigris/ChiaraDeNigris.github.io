title: Social Housing
summary: Social Housing is my first UX project, born from a real challenge I faced while searching for a rental home. This project envisions an application designed to streamline the rental process from the initial search phase to finalizing agreements. For this first phase, I focused primarily on research and design, identifying key pain points in the current rental landscape. Still a work in progress!
